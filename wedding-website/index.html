            <div class="story-text">
                <p>In summer 2022 two people from different sides of the world had the same idea (at least almost the same idea):</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Just graduated from college and with a long summer ahead of him, Sam decided to do a 2-month backpacking trip to South East Asia. No plans, no tickets, just vibes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>A couple thousand miles away, Julie was eagerly planning her 2-week vacation to the same destination. Of course, with a detailed itinerary, a 20€ budget per day - and the plan to "focus on herself" during her first ever solo trip.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>So, on the evening of August 27, these two young travellers found themselves in Bangkok's China Town. Sam, unwillingly stuck in Bangkok, after he was denied entry to Vietnam (as said before no plans just vibes). Julie, starting her long awaited trip and mustering the courage to make some new hostel friends. And both deciding to check out luk hostel's rooftop bar. Julie was looking for a friendly face. Sam was looking to get one drink and go to bed. But alas, after two tuk tuk rides, several shared buckets, and someone lying about their age, the two found themselves in the women's restroom. One down horrendous, the other poorly playing the ukulele.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>What followed were two weeks of endless adventures: Sam following Julie's strict itinerary with 25k steps and only one proper meal per day. Julie coming to terms with extending her 20€ daily budget and slowly realizing, that she would not get the solo trip she had planned, but maybe something even better.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>What both of them didn't realize was that this little Thai romance was gonna turn their lives upside down. A week after Julie's return to Germany, they booked her first of many flights to Seattle. And this was just the beginning. While doing long distance for over 1.5 years, Julie fell in love with Sam's home (including Lucky Boy's breakfast burritos, the abundance of Starbucks locations, and of course his incredible family and friends). Sam started learning German and got a taste of German culture (and German beer) at the Cologne Karneval and Oktoberfest in Munich.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Fast forward to 2024, a lot had changed. The days of daily FaceTime calls, 10-hour plane rides and US border anxiety were finally over. Sam moved to Germany and the two embarked on their biggest adventure so far - moving in together in the exciting city of Berlin.</p>

                <div class="travel-content">
                    <p>We recommend flying into Bari, Puglia's main international airport. From there, you can easily reach Fasano, where the wedding takes place, by car (50 mins) or train (1.5 hours).</p>
                    
                    <p>Many German airports offer direct flights to Bari several times per week (e.g. from Berlin, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich).</p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, there are no direct flights from the US to Bari. However, we checked and you can reach Bari with one layover from almost any major US airport. Alternatively, you can fly direct into Rome and then take a direct train to Bari (the trains in Italy are actually quite cheap and well organized, so this is definitely a solid option to consider).</p>

                    <p>At night, there will be a shuttle back from our venue to the city center of Fasano. We will let you know about the exact pick-up times and location a couple of weeks before the wedding.</p>

                    <p>We highly recommend to rent a car or carpool with other guests to be flexible and get the most out of your stay in Puglia. You will find plenty of different local and international car rental companies at Bari Airport.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you decide to skip on the car rental, you still have good options to get around, as Fasano is well connected through trains and buses. For the day of the wedding, we will have a shuttle from the city center of Fasano to the wedding venue and back at night.</p>

The charming town is quite small but offers a lot of different restaurants, bars and is perfectly located for any kind of day-trips - check the "Things to do" section for some inspiration on how to spend your time around Fasano.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can find plenty of different hotels or apartments in Fasano on the major platforms such as booking.com and Airbnb. However, we can recommend two beautiful places in particular, which are owned by the same lady as our wedding venue:</p>
